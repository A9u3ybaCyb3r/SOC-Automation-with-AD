## üõ°Ô∏è SOC Automation with AD

### üìå Project Summary

**SOC Automation with AD** is a cybersecurity lab simulating real-world Security Operations Center (SOC) workflows. This project involves building a cloud-based Active Directory (AD) environment, detecting unauthorized logins using **Splunk**, and automating response actions via **Shuffle**, a SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) platform.

Deployed entirely in the cloud, this project is designed to mirror the tasks of a Tier 1‚Äì2 SOC analyst and demonstrate capabilities in threat detection, incident response, and security automation.

### üß† Skills Gained

* **Active Directory Configuration**: Domain controller promotion, user creation, domain joins.
* **Security Monitoring with Splunk**: Log ingestion, alert creation for unauthorized logins.
* **SOAR Automation with Shuffle**: Creating automated playbooks that respond to alerts by disabling compromised accounts.
* **Cloud Infrastructure Management**: Deploying virtual machines and configuring firewalls in Vultr (or Azure).
* **Incident Response Workflow**: Real-time Slack and email notifications for analyst triage and response.
* **Diagramming & Network Planning**: Initial architecture planning to visualize the security environment.
